&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article explains why the New York City subway system uses IBM's now discontinued operating system OS/2 for MetroCards. I found it interesting how OS/2 managed to persist in such a big way after becoming mostly obsolete, by essentially being in the right place at the right time and also being stable enough to last until now. The article references the problems caused by the way parts of the system work with each other, but it does not go into detail, so I'm curious to know more. I'm also curious about the fate of OS/2 in the subway now that the MTA is switching to OMNY. I couldn't find anything about this topic after 2019, and now that the plan to phase out the MetroCard has been delayed, I'm interested to see what that means for the system.
